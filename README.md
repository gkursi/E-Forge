# E-klase.lv mods (e-forge)

A way to change the appearance of e-klase and also add some extra functionality to it, with mods!

**Current features**:
* Run just e-klase as an app on your PC
* Add custom CSS

**How to use**:
* If you just want the latest build, click the text "Latest release" under the Links section and download the attached file.
* However, if you want the latest features (unstable), follow this tutorial, and you will hopefully be able to get the latest dev build.
    * **0.** Before building, you need to first install `node.js@18.x.x`
    * **1.** Download and extract the source code.
    * **2.** Open the extracted folder, and in the path bar, type `cmd`.
    * **3.** A new instance of the command prompt should open.
    * **4.** Type `npm init` and press enter until the process is done.
    * **5.** Now, follow the [Electron guide](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start) until the part where you run `npm start`.
    * **6.** If you don't want to just get a ".exe" and you want to modify the code, stop here and just run `npm start` when you want to test the code.
    * **7.** Otherwise, follow the [Electron forge](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/quick-start#package-and-distribute-your-application) guide to build your `exe`.
    * **8.** Now there should be a program that you can run in the /out/ directory.

* If you need any help, feel free to open an issue here on GitHub or DM me on Discord (`_qweru`).
